REAL WORLD SCENARIO
Let's consider a real-world scenario where Jenkins is used in a typical software development workflow:

Version Control: Developers commit their code changes to a version control system like Git.

Continuous Integration: Jenkins is set up to monitor the version control system for changes. Whenever a new commit is made, Jenkins automatically triggers a build process.

Build: Jenkins checks out the latest code from the repository and performs a build process. This typically involves tasks such as compiling the code, running unit tests, and generating build artifacts.

Automated Testing: After the build is successful, Jenkins triggers automated tests. These tests can include unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and more, depending on the project's requirements.

Code Quality Analysis: Jenkins can integrate with code analysis tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle to perform static code analysis and generate reports on code quality, coding standards, and potential issues.

Artifact Storage: Jenkins archives the build artifacts, including compiled binaries, documentation, and other relevant files.

Deployment: Jenkins can deploy the built artifacts to various environments, such as staging or production servers. This can involve tasks like deploying to application servers, configuring databases, or setting up infrastructure.

Notification and Reporting: Jenkins sends notifications to relevant stakeholders, such as developers, testers, or project managers, about the build status, test results, and any issues encountered. It can also generate reports and metrics for monitoring and tracking the progress of the software development process.

Continuous Deployment: Jenkins can be configured to automate the deployment process to production environments based on predefined conditions and approvals. This ensures that code changes are seamlessly delivered to users without manual intervention.

Monitoring and Scaling: Jenkins can integrate with monitoring and alerting tools to track the performance and health of deployed applications. It can also scale the application infrastructure based on predefined rules or triggers.

Scheduled Jobs: Jenkins allows the scheduling of jobs for recurring tasks such as backups, database cleanups, or periodic maintenance tasks.
